# CommandsGPT

An implementation of GPT-4 to recognize instructions. It recognizes which commands it must run to fulfill the user's instruction, using a graph where each node is a command and the data generated by each command can be passed to other commands.

Create new commands easily by describing them using natural language and coding the functions corresponding to the commands.
