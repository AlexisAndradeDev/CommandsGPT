# CommandsGPT

An implementation of GPT-4 to recognize instructions. It recognizes which commands it must run to fulfill the user's instruction, using a graph where each node is a command and the data generated by each command can be passed to other commands.

Create new commands easily by describing them using natural language and coding the functions corresponding to the commands.

# Installation

Install the `commandsgpt` module.

```
pip install commandsgpt
```

If you're using a virtual environment:
```
pipenv install commandsgpt
```

You also have to install the OpenAI package:

```
pip install openai
```

or

```
pipenv install openai
```

# Basic usage

Create a `commands` dictionary that will store the commands described in natural language. Create the functions that will be called when the commands are executed (they must match the arguments and return values of the `commands` dict; the first parameter of these functions must be a Config object). Create a `command_name_to_func` dictionary that will take the name of a command and return the corresponding function.

*Example of commands dictionary*
```python
commands = {
    "REQUEST_USER_INPUT": {
        "description": "Asks the user to input data through the interface.",
        "arguments": {
            "message": {"description": "Message displayed to the user related to the data that will be requested (example: 'Enter your age').", "type": "string"},
        },
        "generates_data": {
            "input": {"description": "Data entered by the user", "type": "string"},
        },
    },
    ...
}
```

*Example of a command function*
```python
def request_user_input_command(config: Config, graph: Graph, message: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    input_ = input(f"{message}\n*: ")
    results = {
        "input": input_,
    }
    return results
```

*Example of command_name_to_func dictionary*
```python
command_name_to_func = {
    "REQUEST_USER_INPUT": request_user_input_command,
    ...
}
```

Add the ***essential commands*** to your commands dictionaries.
* These are the default commands that implement core logic to the model's thinking, like an IF command.
* If you already defined your own core logic commands (IF command, THINK command, etc.), then you are free not to use them.

```python
from commands_gpt.commands.commands_funcs import add_essential_commands
add_essential_commands(commands, command_name_to_func)
```

Your `config` object:
```python
# keyword arguments are optional
config = Config("gpt-4-0314", verbosity=1, explain_graph=True)
```

Create an instruction:

```python
instruction = input("Enter your instruction: ")
```

Pass your instruction to the recognizer model:

```python
graph = recognize_instruction_and_create_graph(
    instruction, config.chat_model, commands, command_name_to_func,
    verbosity=config.verbosity,
)
```

Finally, execute the graph of commands:

```python
graph.execute_commands(config)
```

# Basic example

```python
from typing import Any
from pathlib import Path
from commands_gpt.instruction_recognition import recognize_instruction_and_create_graph
from commands_gpt.commands.graphs import execute_commands
from commands_gpt.config import Config

# Adding custom commands

You can add and modify your own custom commands by creating two dictionaries:

* commands: The commands that the model can use, described in natural language. The keys are the name of the commands, and the values are dictionaries.

    * The nested dictionaries have keys *description*, *arguments* and *generates_data*.

    * **description**: Description of the command in natural language.

    * **arguments**: Arguments that the function of the command receives. It's a dictionary which keys are the names of the arguments, and the values are dictionaries that describe the arguments. 

        * The nested dictionaries have keys *description* and *type*.
        * **description**: Description of the argument in natural language.


        * **type**: Data type. E.g.: "string", "boolean", "int".

    * **generates_data**: The data generated by the command that other commands will be able to access. It's a dictionary which keys are the names of the data field, and the values are dictionaries that describe the data field.

        * The nested dictionaries have keys *description* and *type*.

        * **description**: Description of the data field in natural language.

        * **type**: Data type. E.g.: "string", "boolean", "int".

***Example***
```python
commands = {
    "WRITE_TO_USER": {
        "description": "Writes something to the interface to communicate with the user.",
        "arguments": {
            "content": {"description": "Content to write.", "type": "string"},
        },
        "generates_data": {},
    },
    "REQUEST_USER_INPUT": {
        "description": "Asks the user to input data through the interface.",
        "arguments": {
            "message": {"description": "Message displayed to the user related to the data that will be requested (example: 'Enter your age').", "type": "string"},
        },
        "generates_data": {
            "input": {"description": "Data entered by the user", "type": "string"},
        },
    },
    "WRITE_FILE": {
        "description": "Write a file.",
        "arguments": {
            "content": {"description": "Content that will be written.", "type": "string"},
            "file_path": {"description": "Complete path of the file that will be written.", "type": "string"},
        },
        "generates_data": {},
    },
}
```

* command_name_to_func: The keys of this dictionary are the name of the commands, and the values are the function.

    * The name of the function is irrelevant.

    * The first argument must be the Config object. The second argument is the Graph object.

    * The arguments must match the arguments from the commands dictionary.

    * The return value must be a dictionary which keys must match the "generates_data" key.

    * The data types must match the ones declared in the commands dictionary.

***Example***
```python
def write_to_user_command(config: Config, graph: Graph, content: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # add newlines because regex data injection replaces newline characters
    # by \\n substrings.
    content_with_newlines = "\n".join(content.split("\\n"))
    print(f">>> {content_with_newlines}")
    return {}

def request_user_input_command(config: Config, graph: Graph, message: str) -> dict[str, Any]:

    with open(file_path, "w+", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(content)
        f.close()
    return {}

# add your functions here

    "WRITE_TO_USER": write_to_user_command,
    "REQUEST_USER_INPUT": request_user_input_command,
    "WRITE_FILE": write_file_command,
